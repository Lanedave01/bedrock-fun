Since all data is stored inside the WordPress Database you do not have to worry about a loss of data. If you haven’t touched the source code you can just overwrite the existing files with the new files. Afterwards go to “Theme Options” -> “Manage Presets” (black button upper right corner) and hit “Reload XML”. Further information about changes files are inside the changelog.txt. If you are already using Version 1.3 you can also make use of the Theme Updater. Please note, this requires an official API Key.
